# ICS4U CPT (Soccer Team's SPI Global Ranking)
Soccer, also known as football, is one of the most popular sports in the world. It is a sport that requires teamwork, skill, and strategy. The Soccer Power Index (SPI) is a statistical tool used to evaluate the performance of soccer teams. The SPI uses a variety of metrics to analyze a team's performance, including the number of goals scored, the number of goals conceded, and the team's overall record. The SPI is able to provide an overall rating of a team's performance. The data in the charts represents each country soccer team's soccer power index and their global ranking. The trend shows that a higher SPI rating corresponds to a higher global ranking. The data also compares each country's offensive rating and defensive rating. 

I chose this topic because I have been a fan of soccer for many years. I have always been fascinated by the strategy and athleticism of the game, and enjoy analyzing the performances of different teams and players. I have always wanted to learn more about the sport and how teams are rated. The charts I created enables other soccer fans to contrast their preferred soccer teams and determine which teams are currently performing the best.
